it comprises argumentative essays written by 8th-12th grade English Language Learners (ELLs).
The essays have been scored according to six analytic measures: cohesion, syntax, vocabulary, phraseology, grammar, and conventions.

Each measure represents a component of proficiency in essay writing, with greater scores corresponding to greater proficiency in that measure.
The scores range from 1.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5. Your task is to predict the score of each of the six measures for the essays given in the test set.
